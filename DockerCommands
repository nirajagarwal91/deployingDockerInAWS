1. To run a Docker Container 
  `docker run [container-name]` E.g `docker run hello-world`
  Docker will pull these images form docker hub if not present. Everytime a docker run command is run it wil create a new container with new id.
  
2. To See all the docker containers (both running and not running)
  `docker ps -a`

3. To run docker with interactive shell `docker run -ti --rm ubuntu bash`
    --rm flag will remove the Docker container when done with it
    --ti will give an interactive shell. In this case for ubuntu

4. So what is a docker image? 
    Docker images are minimalistic software that is installed and bundled up to run your program. For example: To run a web page on       docker, you need to install all the dependancies for the front end. 
    
5. Docker run command takes an image and converts it into a living running container. So any file created in the container will stay in the container. If a container is fired from the same image, created file in the previous container will not be present. 

6. Docker Commit command will create images out of the containers. Any file that is created or modified in the working container can be put into an image using a docker commit command. NOTE: It will create a new image.
  `docker commit [Container ID]` 
  This return a SHA256 encrypted image id, which is difficult to remember. To tag now use 
  `docker tag [SHA256 ID got from docker commit] [name of image(user value)]`
